Page was created in 2008 with flash.

While creating this page, I wanted to focus on fine effects and animations to make the page similar like the fanciest one in that era. Unfortunately I did not know how to program that in actionscript yet, so most of the behaviour was made with simple flash tweens. I do not even remember how I integrated the 3D effect of the logo on the startpage... Ultimately the page was working fine, and I learned a lot this time too. Sound design, 3D, photos and scans was made by me.
